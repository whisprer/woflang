What This Extension Adds

Mathematical Logic Symbols ∀, ∃, ∃!, ∈, ∉, ⊆, ∪, ∩, etc.
Logic Connectives →, ↔, ∧, ∨, ¬
Comparison Operators ≤, ≥, ≠, ≡, ≈, ≺
Special Math Symbols ∞, ℵ₀, λ, ∴, ∵, ∎
WofLang Keywords axiom, theorem, proof, lemma, etc.
ASCII Alternatives -, -, =, =, !=, == for when Unicode isn't available

Key Features

Multi-character symbol recognition (like ∃! and -)
Proper Unicode handling for all mathematical symbols
Token type classification so your parser knows what each symbol means
Backward compatibility with your existing SIMD tokenizer

To integrate this
Just replace your simd_tokenize calls with simd_tokenize_logic_aware and use parseWoflangLogic instead of parseWoflangSIMD when you need the enhanced logic symbol support.
Now your beautiful Cantor proof should parse properly! The tokenizer will recognize axiom as a keyword, ∀ as FORALL, ∈ as ELEMENT_OF, → as IMPLIES, and so on.
Time to make woflang mathematically complete, fren! 🐺⚡🧠
