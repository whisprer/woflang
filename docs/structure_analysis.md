Structure Analysis
The codebase is organized into several key components:

Core Interpreter

woflang.hpp/cpp: Main interpreter class, stack handling, and core operations
wof_value.hpp: Stack value types and operations
wof_token.hpp: Tokenization and parsing


Plugin System

woflang_plugin.hpp: Plugin interface
plugin_loader.cpp: Dynamic loading mechanism for DLLs


SIMD Parsing

simd_selector.hpp: Platform detection for SIMD capabilities
simd_utf32_avx2.hpp: AVX2 implementation for fast Unicode parsing
simd_utf32_parser.hpp: Main parsing logic using SIMD


Operations

core_ops.hpp: Built-in operations (arithmetic, stack, meta)
Various plugin implementations for symbolic math, units, specialized domains


REPL and CLI

repl_commands.hpp: REPL command handling
repl_main.cpp: REPL entry point
Various helper files for REPL features


Special Features

Various "sacred" or "forbidden" operations with philosophical implications
Easter eggs and meta-commands
Symbolic math and pattern matching



Identified Issues and Fixes
1. Core Interpreter Issues
1.1. Inconsistent WofValue Structure

Issue: There are multiple definitions of WofValue with different fields across files.
Fix: Standardize on a single comprehensive definition with all needed fields:


1.2. WofType Enum Inconsistency

Issue: WofType definitions vary between files, sometimes including Symbol and Unit.
Fix: Standardize on a complete enum:
cppenum class WofType { Integer, Double, String, Symbol };


1.3. Missing Methods in Interpreter Class

Issue: Some files expect methods like load_plugins() but others use load_plugin().
Fix: Ensure the WoflangInterpreter class has consistent method names and implementations.

2. Plugin System Issues
2.1. Plugin Loading Mechanism

Issue: load_all_plugins() in plugin_loader.cpp doesn't match load_plugins() called in repl_main.cpp.
Fix: Standardize the plugin loading API.

2.2. Inconsistent Plugin Interface

Issue: Some plugin files use a class-based approach, others use free functions.
Fix: Standardize on a single approach, preferably the class-based approach:
cppclass YourPlugin : public WoflangPlugin {
public:
    void register_ops(WoflangInterpreter& interp) override {
        // Register operations
    }
};

WOFLANG_PLUGIN_EXPORT void register_plugin(WoflangInterpreter& interp) {
    static YourPlugin plugin;
    plugin.register_ops(interp);
}

3. SIMD Parsing Issues
3.1. Incomplete SIMD Implementation

Issue: simd_utf32_parser.hpp has an incomplete implementation of tokenization.
Fix: Complete the implementation with proper handling of all whitespace characters.

3.2. Missing Platform Compatibility

Issue: Missing fallback implementation for platforms without AVX2 support.
Fix: Add a scalar fallback implementation.

4. Operation Implementation Issues
4.1. Syntax Errors in Operation Lambdas

Issue: Several lambdas have syntax errors, e.g., in fractal_ops.cpp where parentheses are mismatched.
Fix: Correct all syntax errors in lambda expressions.

4.2. Inconsistent Parameter Handling

Issue: Some operations don't properly check stack size before popping.
Fix: Add consistent stack underflow checks.

4.3. Missing Type Checking

Issue: Many operations assume specific types without checking.
Fix: Add proper type checking before operations.

5. REPL Issues
5.1. Missing REPL Command Registration

Issue: register_repl_extras() is declared but implementations may vary.
Fix: Ensure consistent registration of REPL commands.

5.2. Inconsistent Error Handling

Issue: Different REPL files handle errors differently.
Fix: Standardize error handling throughout REPL code.

6. Build System Issues
6.1. Incomplete CMakeLists.txt

Issue: The CMake files don't properly handle all source files.
Fix: Ensure all sources are included and dependencies are properly specified.

6.2. Missing Plugin Building

Issue: No clear mechanism for building plugins as DLLs.
Fix: Add CMake rules for building each plugin as a separate DLL.
