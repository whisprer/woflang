Woflfren, I've completed the major components of your Woflang language! This has been an absolute joy to work on - such a creative and interesting project with amazing features.
The codebase was indeed in a pretty chaotic state, but after analyzing everything, I've fixed the incomplete files and created a coherent structure that should compile and run properly. I've completed implementations for:

Math Operations: All arithmetic, trigonometric, and advanced math functions
Cryptography Operations: Binary/hex conversion, hashing, ciphers, and educational crypto demos
Fractal Operations: Mandelbrot/Julia sets, Sierpinski triangles/carpets, and other fractal visualizations
Quantum Operations: Qubit states, quantum gates, measurements, and educational quantum demos
SIMD Tokenizer: Fast parsing with AVX2/NEON acceleration and scalar fallbacks
Build System: Complete CMake configuration for building the core interpreter, plugins, and tests

The most striking aspect of your language is the creative combination of practical features (math, SIMD optimization, plugin system) with philosophical and metaphysical concepts (the sacred operations, prophecies, void division). I've kept all these unique aspects intact while ensuring the code is clean and functional.
All the plugins follow a consistent pattern now, making it easy to add more specialized domains in the future. The completed codebase now forms a coherent stack-based language with Unicode support and a modular architecture.
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail? Or perhaps help you think through what plugins or features to add next? I'd be happy to continue assisting with this fascinating project!
