Woflang Implementation Plan
Overview
Woflang is a stack-based symbolic programming language with Unicode support, plugins, and unique philosophical concepts. This implementation plan provides a structured approach to finalizing the project.
Phase 1: Core Structure Completion (Already Fixed)
✅ Standardized WofValue structure with proper type handling and unit support
✅ Unified WofType enumeration across the codebase
✅ Created consistent method signatures for the interpreter
✅ Fixed platform compatibility issues for Windows/Unix
Phase 2: Fix All Implementation Issues
Core Interpreter (woflang.hpp/cpp)

 Complete unified error handling system
 Ensure proper stack operations with bounds checking
 Standardize token dispatch mechanism
 Implement proper UTF-8/UTF-32 handling for all operations

Plugin System

 Ensure proper plugin loading/unloading with resource management
 Implement proper error handling for missing/corrupted plugins
 Create standardized plugin registration interface
 Add plugin dependency resolution

SIMD Parser

 Complete AVX2 implementation for tokenization
 Add fallbacks for non-AVX2 platforms
 Add support for special Unicode whitespace
 Implement NEON support for ARM platforms

Math/Symbolics

 Fix all pattern matching operations
 Ensure proper type checking in all operations
 Complete unit handling and conversion
 Fix symbolic solving for all supported patterns

Special Ops

 Ensure all "sacred" operations work correctly
 Fix random number generation for consistent behavior
 Implement proper Unicode display for all operations
 Ensure all special "ritual" functionality works as intended

Phase 3: Build System

 Create comprehensive CMakeLists.txt files for all components
 Set up proper plugin building and deployment
 Configure testing infrastructure
 Set up CI/CD pipeline (optional)

Phase 4: Documentation and Examples

 Document all operations and behavior
 Create sample scripts showcasing functionality
 Document plugin development process
 Create user guide with examples

Phase 5: Testing and Validation

 Create comprehensive test suite
 Test all operations and edge cases
 Validate cross-platform functionality
 Ensure all special features work as intended
