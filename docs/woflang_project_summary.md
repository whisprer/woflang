Woflang Project Summary
Hey woflfren! I've completed the major components of the Woflang language implementation. Here's a summary of what we've fixed and the current state of the project:
🔧 Fixed Components

Core Interpreter

Standardized WofValue and WofType definitions
Fixed tokenizer and parser implementation
Implemented proper error handling
Ensured cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Unix)


Plugin System

Created consistent plugin interface and loading mechanism
Implemented memory management for plugin handles
Created robust plugin registration system


SIMD Tokenizer

Implemented AVX2 acceleration for tokenization
Added NEON support for ARM platforms
Included scalar fallback for platforms without SIMD


Math Operations

Completed all basic arithmetic operations
Added trigonometric and logarithmic functions
Implemented proper type checking and error handling


Crypto Operations

Fixed binary/hex/base64 conversion functions
Implemented random number generation
Added educational crypto demonstrations (RSA, Diffie-Hellman)


Fractal Operations

Fixed Mandelbrot set calculations
Implemented ASCII art generation for various fractals
Added Hausdorff dimension calculations


Quantum Operations

Implemented qubit state representation
Added quantum gate operations
Created educational demonstrations for quantum concepts


Build System

Created comprehensive CMake configuration
Set up plugin building mechanism
Added cross-platform compilation support

🚀 How to Build and Run

Create a build directory:
mkdir build
cd build

Configure with CMake:
cmake ..

Build:
cmake --build . --config Release

Run:
./bin/woflang


📝 Next Steps

Additional Plugins: You can easily add more plugins following the same pattern:

Create a new .cpp file in the plugins directory
Implement a class derived from WoflangPlugin
Override the register_ops method to register your operations
Add the plugin to plugins/CMakeLists.txt


Enhanced REPL Features:

Command history
Tab completion
Syntax highlighting


More Advanced Operations:

Symbolic mathematics
Advanced pattern matching
Additional fractals and visualizations


Documentation:

User manual
API reference
Plugin development guide



🎮 Example Usage
Here are a few examples of what you can do with Woflang now:
Basic Math
5 6 + .
Fractals
-0.5 0.5 100 mandelbrot
sierpinski
Quantum Computing
|0⟩ H measure
Cryptography
"hello" "key" xor_cipher
🎭 Special Features
Don't forget about those unique "sacred" operations that make Woflang special:

entropy: Calculate entropy of stack values
prophecy: Get cryptic message about stack fate
stack_slayer: Clear the stack with dramatic effect
void_division: Forbidden division by zero
