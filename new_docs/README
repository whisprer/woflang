# WofLang - A Unicode-native Stack Language  

**Creative, Symbolic, Secure Computation for the Modern Era**

---

## Intro  

WofLang isn’t just another programming language—it’s an expressive, artistic, and philosophical computation system built for creative minds.  

Inspired by Forth, J, and symbolic mathematics, WofLang lets you code with Unicode glyphs, manipulate meaning, and explore computation as art, ritual, and logic.

## Quickstart Guide

### Requirements

- C++23 Compiler (MSVC recommended)
- CMake (latest)
- Windows-first, Linux port-friendly

### Building (Windows Example)

```sh
git clone <repo_link>
cd woflang
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
Running
sh
Copy
Edit
cd build
woflang.exe
The REPL launches. You can immediately begin experimenting with Unicode-powered stack operations.

Getting Help
Built-in help command inside REPL

# WofLang Overview  

## Core Concepts

- **Stack-Based**: Operates on a clean stack machine
- **Unicode Native**: Every symbol, rune, and glyph is valid code
- **Modular & Extensible**: Plugins for AI, fractals, quantum ops, symbolic math
- **Philosophical Edge**: Supports sacred geometry, consciousness functions
- **Security First**: Tamper detection, sandboxing, secure plugins
- **SIMD Accelerated**: High-speed Unicode token processing

## Capabilities

- Symbolic math & pattern logic
- Markov AI math suggestion
- Dynamic plugin loading
- Concurrent flow primitives
- Self-modifying, evolving code
- OSINT, compression, and fractal tools
